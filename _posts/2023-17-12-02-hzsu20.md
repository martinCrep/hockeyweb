# IIHF U20 World Championship 2023 – Gold Medal on Home Ice

The 2022/23 season marked my first time playing outside of Slovenia, as I joined the Nordic Hockey Academy (NHA) in Austria. It was a big step, both personally and professionally, and one that proved to be a turning point in my career. The academy was truly international — I played alongside teammates from Finland, Norway, Latvia, Austria, and a few fellow Slovenians. Living and training in such a diverse environment helped me grow quickly and adapt to new styles of play.

On the ice, I had a breakout year. I finished second in total points across the entire U20 league and led the league in goals, becoming the top goal scorer of the season. My confidence grew with every game, and it was clear that all the hard work was starting to pay off.

As a team, we had a great run and made it all the way to the finals. In the end, we took home the silver medal after a tough loss to the Red Bull Salzburg Academy — a strong and well-respected program. Despite the loss, the season was a huge success and a major milestone in my development.

Austria gave me my first real taste of what it means to live and play hockey away from home, and it set the foundation for the challenges I would face in the years to come.
