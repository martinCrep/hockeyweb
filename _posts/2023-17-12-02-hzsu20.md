# IIHF U20 World Championship 2023 – Gold Medal on Home Ice

The 2023 IIHF U20 World Championship was an unforgettable experience — not just because we won gold, but because we did it on home ice, in front of our own fans in Bled, Slovenia. It was a tournament full of emotion, intensity, and national pride. Every game felt like a battle, and every shift carried weight.

We played with heart and determination throughout the tournament, and our team chemistry was incredible. The support from the home crowd gave us extra motivation and created a special atmosphere that we’ll never forget.

The final against Ukraine was a thriller — fast-paced, hard-fought, and full of nerves. It came down to the wire, and I was proud to contribute with an assist on the decisive goal that sealed the victory and secured the gold medal for Slovenia. The moment the puck hit the back of the net, the arena erupted — it was pure joy.

Winning gold in front of our families, friends, and home fans made the victory even more meaningful. It was a moment that will stay with me forever, and one of the proudest highlights of my hockey journey so far.
