# 2024/25 Season Recap

This season was a big step forward in my hockey journey. I played in the German U20 league, where I led my team in points with a total of 50. It was a strong season both personally and for the team, as we made it to the playoffs. Unfortunately, our playoff run ended in the quarterfinals against Krefeld.

One of the highlights of the season was the opportunity to train with the senior team that plays in DEL2. Itâ€™s a respected club with an average of 5,000 fans attending each game. Practicing with experienced professional players was an incredible learning experience and gave me a taste of the next level of competition.
